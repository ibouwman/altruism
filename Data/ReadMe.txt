Three replicate series were performed, using three different collections of seeds.
The results presented in the main figures of the report were generated using replicate 1f.
The seeds used per replicate series are:

Replicate series 1:
Genrand: 3
Jsr_value: 923456789
Jcong_value: 104567891
W_value: 115678912
Z_value: 126789123

Replicate series 2:
Genrand: 2
Jsr_value: 523456789
Jcong_value: 634567891
W_value: 745678912
Z_value: 856789123

Replicate series 3:
Genrand: 1
Jsr_value: 123456789
Jcong_value: 234567891
W_value: 345678912
Z_value: 456789123

Six simulations were performed in every replicate series, that varied with respect to the value of the parameter alpha (final slope of the cost function) and the mutation probability of p.
The combination of parameters that was used is indicated with a letter in the file name:

a: alpha = 1, mutation probability p = 0.001
b: alpha = 0.5, mutation probability p = 0.001
c: alpha = 0.1, mutation probability p = 0.001
d: alpha = 1, mutation probability p = 0.005
e: alpha = 0.5, mutation probability p = 0.005
f: alpha = 0.1, mutation probability p = 0.005

For every simulation, a file named 'runinfo' and a file named 'selection' provide information on the parameters used and the output per time interval.
In addition, for simulation 1f, a series of matrices is included. Every matrix represents the two-dimensional grid, with a value for every grid cell:

densityA: the number of producers per grid cell
densityB: the number of non-producers per grid cell
expalt: the level of public-good availability per grid cell
sumaltr: the sum of the phi value of all individuals per grid cell
sump: the sum of the p value of all individuals per grid cell

The time in the simulation at which the output matrix was generated is included in the name of the file.
